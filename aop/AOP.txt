Aspect Orienter Programming (AOP) in Spring.

AOP helps to modularize cross-cutting concerns (any functionality that affects multiple points of the application and is not business logic of the class, for example logging or security)

AOP Terminology:
 - Aspect - a combination of advice and pointcuts encapsulated in a class.

 - Joinpoints are all possible points during the execution of a program where an advice can be applied. 

 - Pointcuts - collection of join points, where exactly advice should be run.

 - Advice - is a method that is run at particular joinpoint, in other words what code and when it should be run. There 5 kinds of advice:
 * Before - advice is called before the advised method is envied
 * After - advice is called after the advised method completes, regardless whether the method completion was successful or not.
 * After-returning - after the the advised method successfully completes.
 * After-throwing - after the advised method throws an exception.
 * Around - advice wraps the advised method, before and after the advised method is invoked.

 - Introduction - allows to add new methods or attributes to existing classes without changing them.

Spring aspects are implemented as proxies that wrap the target object 
(the object that does business logic). 
The proxy handles method calls, performs additional aspect logic and then calls the target method.

To define an aspect in Spring use @Aspect annotation
To enable AOP in JavaConfig use @EnableAspectJAutoProxy annotation
