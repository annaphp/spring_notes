SPRING REST (REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER)
REST - transferring the state of resources (usually in JSON format) from a server to a 
client or vise versa.

There are two sides you can be on when using REST - producer and consumer (sometimes both).
If you are a producer (meaning sends data and receives user’s responses through a form)
You need to configure REST in your application by doing the following:

To enable REST in Spring you need to configure ViewResolver to return JSON format instead
of HTML.

In Spring there are two ways to transform data into a desired format (JSON) in which
data will be shipped to the client:
 1. Content negotiation - a view is selected that can render the data into a desired
    format to be served to the client.(A view for each format, for example a view named
    products can be in HTML and JSON format).
    To render the right view (the view with correct view name and format) you need to
    configure ContentNegotiatingViewResolver.It it’s a view resolver that determines 
    the requested the media type and find the view for the requested media type.
    
    ContentNegotiantingViewResolver is configured like this:
    @Bean    public ViewResolver cnViewResolver() {      return new ContentNegotiatingViewResolver();    }


 2. Message conversion - a message converter translates an object returned from the
    controller into a desired format to be served to the client.(data produced by the controller
    is transformed into a desired type)
    To enable Message Converter you need to use @RestController annotation in the REST controller
    and specify the returned type on the controller method:
    
    @RestController
    public class ProductRESTController {
   
	@Autowired
	ProductService service;

    	@RequestMapping(value="/products", method=RequestMethod.GET,produces="application/json")
	public List<Product> findAll(){
		return service.findAll();
        }
    }

If you are on the consumer side of the REST (only requesting information in JSON or other format).
Then you need to have a controller that would request information by sending requests to a URL(endpoints)and with a help of Spring RestTemplate the received data will be converted to an object automatically.(no other configuration is required).

Example of a simple RESTConsumer controller:


@Service
public class RestConsumer {
	
        // endpoints - URLs where requests are sent
	private String getUrl = "http://localhost:8080/spring_rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/products/{id}";
	private String postUrl = "http://localhost:8080/spring_rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/product";
	private String getAllUrl = "http://localhost:8080/spring_rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/products";
	
	
	public Product getProduct(Long id){
		return new RestTemplate().getForObject(getUrl, Product.class, id);
	}
	
	public List<Product> getProducts(){
		Product[] response = new RestTemplate().getForObject(getAllUrl, Product[].class);
		return Arrays.asList(response);
	}
	
	public Product postProduct(Product product){
		return new RestTemplate().postForObject(postUrl,product,Product.class);	
	}
