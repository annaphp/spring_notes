Maven helps with:
 - Build process 
 - Project structure
 - Dependency management

POM file(Project Object Model) xml file is a file that contains project information and 
configuration details used to build the project:
 - project dependencies
 - plugins
 - metadata
POM can extend the Super POM.

With Maven a project has build lifecycles and phases. 
The build lifecycle is a process of building and distributing an aftifact(deplorable project)
A phase is a step in the build lifecycle.
Most important default phases:
 - Validate
 - Compile
 - Test
 - Package
 - Install
 - Deploy 
For each step all previous steps are executed. For example if you do mvn install all steps
before install will be executed.

Maven provides standard directory lay out which provides consistency across the projects.
src/main/java - Java source files go here
src/main/resources - resources your application need are here
src/main/filters - resources filters(properties files)
src/main/config - configuration files
src/main/webapp - web application directory for a WAR project
src/test/java - test files
src/test/resources - test resources 
src/test/filters - test resource filter files
src/site - files used to generate the Maven project website

Dependency - a third party or project-local software library. 
In Maven, a shared repository is used to store dependancies, the repository can be
local(m2 in user directory) or remote, there is only one copy of it and it’s store outside the project.
Dependancies are defined in the pom.xml. Maven reads pom.xml and automatically includes their required libraries.(if your project dependancies have their own dependancies - transitive dependancies, Maven takes care of them too).

Dependencies have a scope which affects the class path used for various build tasks and can be defined for all dependencies. 
There are 5 dependency scopes:
 - Compile: available in all classpaths (default)
 - Provided: the JDK or the container provides it
 - Runtime: only required for execution not for compilation
 - Test: only required for testing, not deployed 
 - System: You provide it locally, not looked up in a repo
