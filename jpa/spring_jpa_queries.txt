SPRING JPA QUERIES

JPQL - JPA has its own language to create queries, it’s like SQL but it works with entities and its fields not tables and column names.

Types of JPA Queries:

 - Dynamic
 - Static
 - Native queries

DYNAMIC QUERIES
Dynamic query is a query that is directly defined in a repository and created using JPQL. To create a dynamic 
query createQuery method is called on EntityManager.
Example:
public List<Book> findAllBooks(){
      return entityManager.createQuery("select b from Book b",Book.class).getResultList();
}


STATIC QUERIES
Static query (@NamedQuery) are quires that are defined in the entity class or in metadata file.Static queries
are declared using @NamedQuery for each query and @NamedQueries({}) for a number of queries.
Example:
To declare:
@NamedQuery(name = "findAllUsers",query="select distinct u from User u left join fetch u.roles")

To use:
public List<User> findAllUsers(){
   Query query = em.createNamedQuery("findAllUsers");
   return query.getResultList();	
}

It’s also possible to pass parameters into a dynamic query and static query.
To pass named parameters:
public Book findBookById(Long id){
    return entityManager.createQuery(“select b from Book b where b.id = :id”)
                        .setParameter(“id”, id)
                        .getSingeResult();
}

To pass positional parameters:

public List findWithName(String name) {
    return em.createQuery(
        “select b from Book b where b.name like ?1”)
        .setParameter(1, name)
        .getResultList();
}


NATIVE QUERIES
Native quires are queries that are defined in repository and created using SQL.
Example:

public List<User> findAllUsers(){
   return  entityManager.createNativeQuery(“select * from user”, User.class).getResultList(); 
}
