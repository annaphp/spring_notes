Transactions in Spring

Transactions have the following properties:

- Atomicity - All operations within a transaction are completed, the transaction is rolled 
back if one of the operations fails.

- Consistency - data should be saved always according to the business rules

- Durability - ensures that the result of a committed transaction persists in case of a system failure.

- Isolation - what your transaction sees in relation to changes made by others.
Isolation enables transactions to operate independently of and transparent to each other. As if there where only one user to use a database.

Isolation Levels:
- read uncommitted - allows dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads
- read committed - allows non-repeatable reads, phantom reads
- repeatable read - allows phantom reads only
- serializable - doesn’t allow dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads

Transactions can be local or global. Local transactions work with one database, global 
with more than one.

Types of transaction management in Spring:
 - Declarative - using annotations within the code itself.
 - Programmatic - developer writes code to manage transactions

In Spring, to make a method transactional use @Transactional annotation which supports
a number of attributes that can be used to override the default behaviour and specify
transaction propagation. For example if your method only finds information you can use 
@Transactional(readOnly=true).
